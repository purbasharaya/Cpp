_why cpp? what is so good about this?_

_this is my journey of learning the language half of the developers are so fond of!_

OOP language (abstraction, encap, inheritance, poly)
Not pure OOPs (why? We need not write it in OOP form always, and can write it in functional form)
Extension to C
Bjarne Stroustrup (developed in bell labs)
Prev known as C with classes, later changed to c++

C++ is a
-Statically typed (create variable of certain type then start using it)
-Free form (no actual form for writing code)
-Compiled (first the machine understands the code before running (from main to functions))
-General-purpose language (you can write code for almost anything (gaming, SDE, driver development etc))

Cpp is best because:
Generally all the gaming engines are build on cpp
Object oriented way of developing
Fast execution (less overhead than other languages)
